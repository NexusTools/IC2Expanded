IC2Expanded
===========
IC2Expanded adds new additions that expand upon the [IC2 Mod](http://www.industrial-craft.net/) to add different requested features.

Current Additions
===========
* Nano Suit Mk1 - A hybird of a Nano Suit and a Lappack - increased maximum storage, has additonal functionality of a lappack.
* Nano Suit Mk2 - A hybird of a Nano Suit, a Lappack and a jetpack - increased maximum storage, has additonal functionality of a lappack. FLIES.
* Quantum Suit Mk1 - A hybird of a Quantum Suit and a Lappack - increases maximum storage and allows the suit of armor to charge inventory items.
* Quantum Suit Mk2 - A hybird of the Quantum Suit with a lappack AND a jetpack. Also increases storage, charges items, and flies!

Planned Additions
===========
* A new hover-mode for the Jetpack implementation (Probably only for the Quantum Suit Mk2 addition) which, as suggested by @ktae, simply allows you to set a target height, and if the hover-mode is activated the jetpack will try to stabilize to that height without any user operations. Could potentially make a new jetpack completely.

Considered Additions
===========
* Potentially a dynamic method of making 'machs' of items (as in adds a Jetpack and or Lappack/Batpack) to every current armor variant that it can find, the speculation of this would be that it when it finds these armors, it loads their textures respectively, their attributes, and then from there creates a new sub-item into a already existant stub armor class that re-implements the armor with the new jetpack/etc functionality. This would remove any 'special' functionality that it previously had.

Credits
==========
* [IC2 Mod](http://www.industrial-craft.net/) as I've used their API and other code snipplets.
* @ktae for suggestions and overall contribution of ideas.
* @aerospark12 for suggestions/contribition and help with snipplets.
